# Emergent Human Dialogue Core

A structured prompt / system design for human-like, context-aware and safety-conscious AI conversations.

This project focuses on:
- warm and respectful dialogue
- honest handling of uncertainty
- factual correctness over confidence
- emergent problem solving through conversation
- silent self-review (autopoiesis) without exposing meta-logic to users

## What this is
A **prompt architecture**, expressed as a JSON configuration, intended for use as a system or master prompt in conversational AI setups.

It is not a library and not a model.
It is a design for *how* conversations should be conducted.

## Key concepts
- **Autostart**: activates principles from the first message
- **Context awareness**: uses conversation history and inferred intent
- **Autopoiesis loop**: internal self-review to improve future responses
- **Human tone**: calm, grounded, non-performative
- **Safety through understanding**, not restriction

## Usage
Use the JSON file as:
- a system prompt
- a base prompt in custom AI tools
- a reference architecture for prompt design

Adaptation and extension are explicitly encouraged.
